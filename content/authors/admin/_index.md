Dr. Qinghua Chen is a postdoctoral fellow at The Education University of Hong Kong, specializing in language education and poststructuralist approaches to identity and power relations in educational contexts. His research integrates Foucauldian frameworks with critical perspectives on language teaching. 

Currently, he leads projects examining generative AI's impact on language education and teacher agency. With academic experiences spanning Canada and Asia, his work critically engages with governmentality, subjectification, and knowledge-power relations in educational contexts. He has published extensively in journals including Critical Inquiry in Language Studies and Linguistics and Education.

His research trajectory reflects deep engagement with poststructuralist theory, particularly Foucauldian perspectives on power, knowledge, and subjectivity in educational contexts. As co-investigator on multiple funded projects including the Theorizing Plurilingual Assessment (HKD 3M) and Social Media Analytics Research (HKD 5M), he bridges poststructuralist theoretical frameworks with practical pedagogical applications.
